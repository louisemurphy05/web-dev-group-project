                            In the original (1984) Mirage comics, leonardo was the most responsible, often instructing his brothers and strategizing fighting plans. His stoicism and discipline helped lead his brothers to victory.
                            In the Archie comics(1988), Leonardo retained his leadership role, but became more compassionate and kinder, grounded in his morals and becoming more pacfist leaning.
                            In the Image comics (1996) Leonardo loses a hand and becomes more cold and ruthless, battle-hardened and less merciful.

                            In The movies, more sides of Leonardos character are explored. In the 1990 movie Leonardo is depicted as his strict and calculating self, often reprimanding his brothers for their mistakes.
                            In the 1991 movie TMNT II: The Secret of the Ooze, Leonardo is more relaxed and fun-loving, often joking with his brothers and having fun. A much more kid friendly adaptation.
                            In the live action (2014-2016) movies, Leonardo is depicted with a more bulky apperance like his brothers, giving off a much more intimidating and fearsome look. Throughout this film Leo fights with his sense of duty and fear of losing his brothers, this often leads to him getting into fights with his brothers.

                            In the TV shows, Leonarod also manages to show a more classic cartoon style of his character. In the (1987) TV show, Leo is the clean-cut leader. Polite and disciplined, but a bland in personality compared to his brothers.
                            In the Nickelodeon (2012) show, Leonardo is depicted as a more free going fun-loving character. He shows genuine feelings of anxiety as his role as the leader, often confiding in is father and sensei Master Splinter for support. 
                            In the (2018) show, Leonardo this time isn't the leader of the turtles, instead it is Raphael. In this rendition, Leonardo is the sarcastic trickster of the group, often pranking his other members constantly.
