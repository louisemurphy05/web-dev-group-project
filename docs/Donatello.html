                            Donatello, nicknamed "Donnie," is the most intelligent of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
                            With his scientific mind, he excels in engineering, technology, and problem-solving, often crafting gadgets to aid his brothers. 
                            Though highly logical, he can be socially awkward, sometimes overcomplicating explanations or missing social cues. Despite his reserved nature, 
                            Donnie is deeply loyal to his family, and uses his intelligence to protect them. 
                            Donatello is also known for wearing purple and fighting with a bō staff as well as having an abundance of high-tech gadgets to help him and his brothers.

                            Donatello was created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984 as one of four brothers mutated by radioactive ooze from New York sewers. 
                            Trained in ninjutsu by their rat sensei, Splinter, Donatello became the teams tech expert, wielding a bō staff and crafting gadgets. 
                            His character evolved across adaptations, from the gritty 1984 comics to lighter animated series like the 1987 show
                            and the 2012 reboot. Later versions, such as Rise of the TMNT (2018) and Mutant Mayhem (2023),
                            further highlighted his tech skills with advanced visors and hacking abilities, solidifying his role as the intellectual backbone.

                        To align with Donatello's nerdy nature he is often depicted wearing some broken glasses
                        and some high-tech headgear. This was especially prevelent in the live action adaptation of the Teenage 
                        Mutant Nija Turtles, released in 2014, where donatello uses his knowledge of tech and equipment to give him 
                        and his brothers the advantage through the enhanced vision and communication his headgear allows.

                        Donatello weilds the bō staff, a weapon that suits his tactical and analytical style. He prefers precision over raw power so
                        using the staff allows him to create space and control fights with calculated strikes and expert defense. 
                        Ever the inventor, he sometimes upgrades it with tech like extendable segments or shock capabilities.
                        Though less flashy than his brothers' weapons, the bō perfectly reflects his approach to combat.

                            In the original (1984) Mirage comics, Donatello was the smartest brother, often building tech to aid missions.
                            Unlike later versions, early comics portrayed him as equally violent in combat. His character evolved significantly in Archie's TMNT Adventures (1989),
                            emphasizing his genius and pacifist leanings which reflects how he is potrayed even today.

                            Donatello shares a close bond with his 3 brothers, Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo as well as their rat sensei 'Splinter'. 
                            Despite their friendship he is occasionally clashing with hot-headed Raphael, however he maintains 
                            a particularly strong partnership with Leonardo. 
                            Their family dynamic centers on mutual loyalty despite differing personalities.

                            In the animated series, Donatello's tech skills shine brightest. The (1987) cartoon made him the nerdy gadgeteer, 
                            while the (2003) version added combat prowess. Rise of the TMNT (2012) reimagined him as a mystic-tech hybrid, 
                            and Mutant Mayhem (2023) highlights his social awkwardness. All iterations emphasize his inventive genius and purple bandana.
